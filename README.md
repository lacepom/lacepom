![](https://file.garden/Zpt04KL0r1V-kQd1/decos/fb8555af.gif) Hello! You can call me Dove or Lace! I am a digital artist first and foremost, but a coding hobbyist and gamedev secondary! 
I love to create websites, and games! (mainly renpy and rpgmaker)

I am happily married, I would do anything for my husband! 
<br><br>
I'm also an arch linux enthusiast! I might have a hard time grasping new coding languages and such, but give me time and patience and I will get better <3
I am someone who will always try something at least once! 
<br><br>
If you have any questions or concerns feel free to email me @ lacepom@pm.me ![](https://file.garden/Zpt04KL0r1V-kQd1/decos/fb8555af.gif)
